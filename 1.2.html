  <p class="message">Successfully clone the student facing repo located in gitlab. This is where all of the class
    activities exist
    (solved and unsolved), the homework instructions and solutions, and any other supplemental information. There is
    loads of extra information, including links to great documentation sites within the README.md files</p>
  <p class="info">To clone the student facing repo...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You will need to upload an ssh key to gitlab, which is this url https://upenn.bootcampcontent.com/. You can
      reuse your github ssh key, or create a new one. To upload the ssh key, go to your gitlab's user settings. There is
      a section for ssh keys. Add there.</li>
    <li>Once the key is uploaded, you can run a "git clone (nameOfRepo)" command within the terminal. To obtain the
      name of the repo, go to https://upenn.bootcampcontent.com/. Click the link for "UPENN-PHI-FSF-PT-02-2020-U-C".
      Look for the blue clone bottom in the top right corner, click it, and copy the url for <strong>clone with
        ssh</strong></li>
    <li>Open a terminal. Navigate to the directory you desire, and enter a cmd like "git clone
      git@upenn.bootcampcontent.com:upenn-bootcamp/upenn-phi-fsf-pt-02-2020-u-c.git"</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="info">If that was successful, you should have a new directory created with all of the files from the student
    fancing repo. That repo will be updated throughout each class, and sporadically throughout the week. Expect to run
    many git pull cmds against that repo.</p>
  <p class="info">If none of this makes sense, don't sweat it, that is completely normal. If you need help, feel free to
    ask one of your peers, myself, or the TAs.</p>
